    "answer": "#### Answer: D",
    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: D\n\nWithin the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.\n\nVariables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.\n\n</p>"

    "answer": "#### Answer: C",
    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: C\n\nBecause of the event queue in JavaScript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called _after_ the loop has been executed. Since the variable `i` in the first loop was declared using the `var` keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of `i` by `1` each time, using the unary operator `++`. By the time the `setTimeout` callback function was invoked, `i` was equal to `3` in the first example.\n\nIn the second loop, the variable `i` was declared using the `let` keyword: variables declared with the `let` (and `const`) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between `{ }`). During each iteration, `i` will have a new value, and each value is scoped inside the loop.\n\n</p>"

    "answer": "#### Answer: B",
    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: B\n\nNote that the value of `diameter` is a regular function, whereas the value of `perimeter` is an arrow function.\n\nWith arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call `perimeter`, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).\n\nThere is no value `radius` on that object, which returns `undefined`.\n\n</p>"

    "answer": "#### Answer: A",
    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: A\n\nIn JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not _type_ them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.\n\nJavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.\n\n`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `\"small\"`. `mouse[\"small\"]` returns `true`\n\nHowever, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property \"size\" of undefined`.\n\n</p>"

    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: C\n\n`new Number()` is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object.\n\nWhen we use the `==` operator, it only checks whether it has the same _value_. They both have the value of `3`, so it returns `true`.\n\nHowever, when we use the `===` operator, both value _and_ type should be the same. It's not: `new Number()` is not a number, it's an **object**. Both return `false.`\n\n</p>"

Static methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are created, and cannot be passed down to any children.

    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: A\n\nIt logs the object, because we just created an empty object on the global object! When we mistyped `greeting` as `greetign`, the JS interpreter actually saw this as `global.greetign = {}` (or `window.greetign = {}` in a browser).\n\nIn order to avoid this, we can use `\"use strict\"`.

If you want to add a feature to all objects at once, you have to use the prototype instead.

Say that we added this method to the constructor itself. Maybe not every `Person` instance needed this method. This would waste a lot of memory space, since they would still have that property, which takes of memory space for each instance. Instead, if we only add it to the prototype, we just have it at one spot in memory, yet they all have access to it!\n\n</p>"

The base object is the object created by the user, or an object that is created using the `new` keyword. The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as `.toString`. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of such methods are available on the prototype. Although JavaScript can't find it directly on your object, it goes down the prototype chain and finds it there, which makes it accessible for you.\n\n</p>"

Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called _implicit type coercion_. **Coercion** is converting from one type into another.\n\nIn this example, JavaScript converts the number `1` into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (`1`) and a string type (`'2'`), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like `\"Hello\" + \"World\"`, so what's happening here is `\"1\" + \"2\"` which returns `\"12\"`.\n\n</p>"

This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the object using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates.

    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: C\n\nRegular functions cannot be stopped mid-way after invocation. However, a generator function can be \"stopped\" midway, and later continue from where it stopped. Every time a generator function encounters a `yield` keyword, the function yields the value specified after it. Note that the generator function in that case doesn’t _return_ the value, it _yields_ the value.\n\nFirst, we initialize the generator function with `i` equal to `10`. We invoke the generator function using the `next()` method. The first time we invoke the generator function, `i` is equal to `10`. It encounters the first `yield` keyword: it yields the value of `i`. The generator is now \"paused\", and `10` gets logged.\n\nThen, we invoke the function again with the `next()` method. It starts to continue where it stopped previously, still with `i` equal to `10`. Now, it encounters the next `yield` keyword, and yields `i * 2`. `i` is equal to `10`, so it returns `10 * 2`, which is `20`. This results in `10, 20`.\n\n</p>"

    "answer": "#### Answer: C",
    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: C\n\nIn ES6, we can initialize parameters with a default value. The value of the parameter will be the default value, if no other value has been passed to the function, or if the value of the parameter is `\"undefined\"`. In this case, we spread the properties of the `value` object into a new object, so `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`.\n\nThe default argument is evaluated at _call time_! Every time we call the function, a _new_ object is created. We invoke the `multiply` function the first two times without passing a value: `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`. We then log the multiplied value of that number, which is `20`.\n\nThe third time we invoke multiply, we do pass an argument: the object called `value`. The `*=` operator is actually shorthand for `x.number = x.number * 2`: we modify the value of `x.number`, and log the multiplied value `20`. \n\nThe fourth time, we pass the `value` object again. `x.number` was previously modified to `20`, so `x.number *= 2` logs `40`. \n\n</p>"

    "answer": "#### Answer: D",
    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: D\n\nThe first argument that the `reduce` method receives is the _accumulator_, `x` in this case. The second argument is the _current value_, `y`. With the reduce method, we execute a callback function on every element in the array, which could ultimately result in one single value. \n\nIn this example, we are not returning any values, we are simply logging the values of the accumulator and the current value.\n\nThe value of the accumulator is equal to the previously returned value of the callback function. If you don't pass the optional `initialValue` argument to the `reduce` method, the accumulator is equal to the first element on the first call.\n\nOn the first call, the accumulator (`x`) is `1`, and the current value (`y`) is `2`. We don't return from the callback function, we log the accumulator and current value: `1` and `2` get logged.  \n\nIf you don't return a value from a function, it returns `undefined`. On the next call, the accumulator is `undefined`, and the current value is `3`. `undefined` and `3` get logged. \n\nOn the fourth call, we again don't return from the callback function. The accumulator is again `undefined`, and the current value is `4`. `undefined` and `4` get logged.\n</p>"

If you try to do that, it will throw a ReferenceError: 1 and 4 would throw a reference error.\n\nWith the `super` keyword, we call that parent class's constructor with the given arguments. The parent's constructor receives the `name` argument, so we need to pass `name` to `super`. \n\nThe `Labrador` class receives two arguments, `name` since it extends `Dog`, and `size` as an extra property on the `Labrador` class. They both need to be passed to the constructor function on `Labrador`, which is done correctly  using constructor 2.\n</p>"

This gets returned from the `addToList` function.\n\nThe `push` method modifies the original array.

    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: B\n\n`Object.freeze` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).\n\nWhen we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`. In this case, `Object.isFrozen(shape)` returns true, since the variable `shape` has a reference to a frozen object.\n\nSince `shape` is frozen, and since the value of `x` is not an object, we cannot modify the property `x`. `x` is still equal to `10`, and `{ x: 10, y: 20 }` gets logged.\n\n</p>"

    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: C\n\nThe `add` function is a _memoized_ function. With memoization, we can cache the results of a function in order to speed up its execution. In this case, we create a `cache` object that stores the previously returned values.\n\nIf we call the `addFunction` function again with the same argument, it first checks whether it has already gotten that value in its cache. If that's the case, the caches value will be returned, which saves on execution time. Else, if it's not cached, it will calculate the value and store it afterwards.\n\nWe call the `addFunction` function three times with the same value: on the first invocation, the value of the function when `num` is equal to `10` isn't cached yet. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `false`, and the else block gets executed: `Calculated! 20` gets logged, and the value of the result gets added to the cache object. `cache` now looks like `{ 10: 20 }`.\n\nThe second time, the `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.\n\nThe third time, we pass `5 * 2` to the function which gets evaluated to `10`.

By setting `newList` equal to `[1, 2, 3].push(4)`, we set `newList` equal to the new length of the array: `4`. \n\nThen, we try to use the `.push` method on `newList`. Since `newList` is the numerical value `4`, we cannot use the `.push` method: a TypeError is thrown.\n\n</p>"

    "answer": "#### Answer: D",
    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: D\n\nRegular functions, such as the `giveLydiaPizza` function, have a `prototype` property, which is an object (prototype object) with a `constructor` property. Arrow functions however, such as the `giveLydiaChocolate` function, do not have this `prototype` property. `undefined` gets returned when trying to access the `prototype` property using `giveLydiaChocolate.prototype`. \n\n</p>"

    "explanation": "<p>\n\n#### Answer: A\n\n`Object.entries(person)` returns an array of nested arrays, containing the keys and objects:\n\n`[ [ 'name', 'Lydia' ], [ 'age', 21 ] ]` \n\nUsing the `for-of` loop, we can iterate over each element in the array, the subarrays in this case. We can destructure the subarrays instantly in the for-of loop, using `const [x, y]`. `x` is equal to the first element in the subarray, `y` is equal to the second element in the subarray. \n\nThe first subarray is `[ \"name\", \"Lydia\" ]`, with `x` equal to `\"name\"`, and `y` equal to `\"Lydia\"`, which get logged.\nThe second subarray is `[ \"age\", 21 ]`, with `x` equal to `\"age\"`, and `y` equal to `21`, which get logged.\n\n</p>"

This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc. \n\nHere, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a _new line_. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:\n\n```javascript\n  return;\n  a + b\n```",

The Symbol won't be visible, and an empty array is returned. When logging the entire object, all properties will be visible, even non-enumerable ones.\n\nThis is one of the many qualities of a symbol: besides representing an entirely unique value (which prevents accidental name collision on objects, for example when working with 2 libraries that want to add properties to the same object), you can also \"hide\" properties on objects this way (although not entirely. You can still access symbols using the `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` method).\n\n</p>"

Between the parentheses of the `getList` function, we destructure this array right away. You could see this as:\n\n `[x, ...y] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n\n With the rest parameter `...y`, we put all \"remaining\" arguments in an array. The remaining arguments are `2`, `3` and `4` in this case. The value of `y` is an array, containig all the rest parameters. The value of `x` is equal to `1` in this case, so when we log `[x, y]`, `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` gets logged.\n\n The `getUser` function receives an object. With arrow functions, we don't _have_ to write curly brackets if we just return one value. However, if you want to return an _object_ from an arrow function, you have to write it between parentheses, otherwise no value gets returned!
